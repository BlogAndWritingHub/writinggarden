It all started in 2015 where I and he was 4 years old. We both was in LKG in the KidZee School, Khardaha. We were small and new to the world. It was a very colorful and interesting world. For us, it was fun world. We played and do all sorts of fun. The life was fun, no responsibility, no duties. I do not remember that much but still, I am telling what I remember.
